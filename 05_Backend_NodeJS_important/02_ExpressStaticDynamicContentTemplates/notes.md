The aim of the project is to transform the static site (HTML, CSS, Javascript code) into a dynamic site that is served by app.js.

## STATIC FILES
Files that are never changed by server side code: they can be Javascript files, CSS files, HTML files (here they are static but later in the course they will become dynamic)
