# SQL Databases - Introduction & Core Concepts

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the language used to talk to Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS), which are systems that store data in multiple (many many) tables. The data in those tables is normalized and clearly structured: they have clearly defined schemas and data types.
Data and relations can be queried; queries can be made also across multiple tables to query for connected records.

If you open the MySQL Workbench (the graphic UI for the database server) you can start creating databases (or "schemas") and every database can have multiple tables (and these tables will hold the actual data records)
