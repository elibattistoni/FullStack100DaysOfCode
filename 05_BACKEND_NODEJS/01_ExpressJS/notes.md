At this moment, before starting this lecture, we don't sully use the advantages NodeJS offers to us.
For example, we are not talking to a DB.

However, with just NodeJS we have certain limitations, more specifically, we have extra unnecessary work to do.
For example, for every website that we build, we have to create that NodeJS server on our own and define the function for handling requests.

Typically we don't work with just NodeJS in this way: we use a third-party library on top of NodeJS to make our life easier.
This lectures section is about NodeJS development with a third party library called **ExpressJS**
